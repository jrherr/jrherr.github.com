### Manning Lab Meeting Notes - Friday January 17th 2014

#### Discussion of strategies for Brian's Phage study

Need to get better DNA yields for metagenomic sequencing of the Human gut phage community -- in some low phage concentration cases he needs up to 500 grams of fecal material

It might be possible to use [multiple displacement amplification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_displacement_amplification) in increase yields.

Brian will make an spreadsheet with all the samples that we will attempt to sequence for phage metagenomics.  I will optimize his metagenomic partitioning and database for phage sequence identification and assembly.  I suggested that we do Illumina sequencing of barcoded samples.

Check on the following: look for remnant of phage in metagenome datasets, tail region (or other region) primer design, may be possible to "deactivate" <i>Stx</i> gene and create "tag" to monitor phage in experimental populations -- think more about this.

Check on ways of monitoring [temperate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate_phage) and [lytic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lytic_cycle)/[lysogenic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysogenic_cycle) phases.  Read [classic review](http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.mi.28.100174.001405?journalCode=micro) on this.

Check on DNA sequencing for Phage plaque assays.

Strains to possibly use for experimental study: <i>Salmonella</i>, <i>Shigella</i>, EPEC versus EHAE, <i>E. coli</i> O157 Spinach Strain, EAE Cattle Isolate.

Pan-Genomics -- big project of ongoing work.

Read these papers: [Development and application of a method for the purification of free shigatoxigenic bacteriophage from environmental samples](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016770121200276X) and [Comparative genomics of Shiga toxin encoding bacteriophages](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/13/311/).
