### Manning Lab Meeting Notes - Friday January 17th 2014

#### Discussion of strategies for Brian's Phage study

Need to get better DNA yields for metagenomic sequencing of the Human gut phage community -- in some low phage concentration cases he needs up to 500 grams of fecal material

It might be possible to use [multiple displacement amplification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_displacement_amplification) in increase yields.

Brian will make an spreadsheet with all the samples that we will attempt to sequence for phage metagenomics.  Josh will optimize his metagenomic partitioning and database for phage sequence identification and assembly.  Illumina sequencing of barcoded samples.

Check on: look for remnant of phage in metagenome datasets, tail region (or other region) primer design, possible to "deactivate" Stx gene and create "tag" to monitor phage in experimental populations -- think more about this.

Check on ways of monitoring [temperate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate_phage) and [lytic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lytic_cycle)/[lysogenic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysogenic_cycle) phases.  Read [classic review](http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.mi.28.100174.001405?journalCode=micro) on this.

Check on DNA sequencing for Phage plaque assays.

Strains to possibly use for experimental study: <i>Salmonella</i>, <i>Shigella</i>, EPEC vs. EHAE, O157 Spinach Strain, EAE Cattle Isolate.

PanGenomics -- big project of ongoing work.
