### Brown Lab Meeting Notes on implementation of khmer in Galaxy

Michael presented his efforts in getting the [Eel pond data](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/tag/eel%20pond.html) into a [Galaxy](http://galaxyproject.org/) workflow so that the khmer protocols will be easily accessible for those who are not so command line savvy.

I commented a bit on the Galaxy development at Penn State and what Galaxy is (and what it isn't) for those who had never used Galaxy before.

Michael has had to do a re-write of khmer tools for Galaxy - see [khmer documentation](http://khmer.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)

Basic run down has been to install Galaxy on Athyra server and then test the khmer documentation workflow

read the doc website for khmer -- check for khmer in [Galaxy toolshed](http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/) (one outside lab user has installed the development version for Galaxy now).
