### Brown Lab Meeting Notes on implementation of khmer in Galaxy

Michael presented his efforts in getting the Eel pond dataset into a Galaxy workflow so that the khmer protocols will be
easily accessible for those who are not so command line savvy.

I commented a bit on the Galaxy development at Penn State and what Galaxy is and what it isn't for those who had never used Galaxy before.

Michael has had to do a re-write of khmer tools for Galaxy - see khmer documentation

Basic run down has been to install Galaxy on Athyrx server and then test the khmer documentation workflow

read the doc website for khmer -- check for khmer in Galaxy toolshed (one outside lab user has installed the development version for Galaxy now).
